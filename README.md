## About
The Cinema Trivia game asks the user to answer 7 multiple choice movie questions. The user will be timed
from the moment they hit the start button and will have 30 seconds to answer each question. If answered
correctly, the user will be rewarded with a positive gif relating to the movie in question, otherwise, the 
gif will be more chastising in nature.

## How to Play
To begin the game, the user hit the start button. The first question will appear and the timer will begin
counting down from 30 seconds.

The user should choose one of the four answers. If the answer is correct, a rewarding gif will populate 
about the movie related to the question.

If the answer is incorrect, or if the user fails to answer within the alloted time, then a different gif
will populate. The next question will automatically generate after 5 seconds.
